# Resources

üëã I'm Katie a 3rd year PhD candidate at the University of Cambridge. Making the transition to cheminformatics/computational chemistry can be difficult. During my PhD I have accumilated a number of resources I wish someone had shown me the day I started, so here are these resources!

Packages üì¶
-------

* RDKit - https://www.rdkit.org/docs/index.html Most common cheminformatics package
* DataMol - https://datamol.io/ Open source toolkit of cheminformatics tools, some built upon RDKit
* Exmol - https://github.com/ur-whitelab/exmol Model agnostic explainability methods for ML for chemistry
* Plotly - https://plotly.com/python/ Graphing package, can be difficult initially but it allows for a large amount of customization and can even be used to generate interactive plots

Cheminformatics resources ‚öõÔ∏è
------------------------

* TeachOpenCADD - https://projects.volkamerlab.org/teachopencadd/ Open source course on computer aided drug design from the Volkamer lab, complete with Juypter notebooks
* Practical Cheminformatics - https://practicalcheminformatics.blogspot.com/ Cheminformatics blog
* Is life worth living? - https://iwatobipen.wordpress.com/ Cheminformatics blog


PhD/Research resources üéì
